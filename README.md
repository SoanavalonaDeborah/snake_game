Snake Game using C++

|"Compiling Instructions"|

This "Snake Game" is created using graphics.h library, using cpp.
I have used CodeBlocks and externally dropped graphics.h in its compiler include folder.



Source code is provided with the commit as 'main.cpp' but to compile the code one must have graphics.h in their include folder of cpp compiler. 
Use Turbo C++ in order to compile the code, as it has graphics.h by default.

*OR YOU CAN DIRECTLY RUN .exe FILE TO PLAY THE GAME*

|"Playing Instructions"|

Use Arrow keys to change the direction of the snake.
